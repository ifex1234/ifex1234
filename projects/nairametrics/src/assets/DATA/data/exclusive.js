        title: "What will save the naira? ",
        content:`The value of the naira on the parallel market has shown recent stability after a
        significant decline. Some attribute this to fortuitous events and government
        actions, while others express skepticism about the sustainability of the naira
        rally.
        Dr. Ayo Teriba, CEO of Economic Associates (EA), links the naira’s strength to
        the Supreme Court’s judgment in favour of President Bola Tinubu, lifting political
        uncertainty.
        He also highlights positive announcements by the Central Bank of Nigeria
        (CBN), including the lifting of the ban on 43 items, as contributing factors.
        Following a steep plunge in the value of the naira on the parallel market over the past
        four months, there has been a respite over the past several days.
        While some economists ascribe the lull to a turning point due to fortuity and
        government actions, others posit that the fundamentals are not yet right for a
        sustained naira rally.
        The chief executive of Economic Associates (EA), Dr. Ayo Teriba, observed that the
        naira started gaining strength since October 27, the day after the Supreme Court
        judgment in favour of President Bola Tinubu.
        “I believe that the Supreme Court lifted the cloud of political uncertainty that had
        built up in the approach to the election and might have thickened by the rejection
        of the petition of the major political opponents. The petitions against the
        president might have made some neutral observers to want to withdraw their
        money from Nigeria. So the Supreme Court’s verdict made them to realize that
        there is not going to be chaos and anarchy. So anybody who was hesitant to
        bring his money in can feel confident to do so.
        “That, I think, is the most important thing at work. Another thing is that the $11
        billion that Nigeria would have lost in the P&ID case, for which I believe the
        government had to provide a bank guarantee, might have restrained the CBN
        from making use of $11 billion of her reserves, which the judgment of the British
        Court lifted. That might be the source, which the CBN has room to clear out
        some of its arrears. So, two favourable and positive announcements by the
        CBN, including the lifting of the ban on the 43 items, have strengthened the
        naira. It was that judgment that set Nigeria free from an $11 billion burden.
        “Added to that is the fact that the CBN has begun to clear the backlog of forex
        obligations. We don’t know the extent to which they have cleared it. It would be
        good if they can clear it fully. Will it be sustained? It remains to be seen,” he said.
        Referring to the naira rally on the parallel market, Isa AbdulMumin, the CBN’s
        director of corporate communications, noted that the move to unban 43 items from
        accessing forex on the I&E window will reduce pressure on the naira in the parallel
        market. Importers of those 43 items had to access US dollars by themselves.
        However, the chief executive of Anthill Concepts Ltd, Dr. Emeka Okengwu, while
        welcoming the naira rally development, noted that as long as the country is not
        producing goods and services in tandem with the supply of money, the naira will
        continue to slide against other currencies.
        Dr. Gbenga Omotoso, an economist and social affairs analyst, on his part, told
        Nairametrics that the Tinubu government must imbibe fiscal discipline in order to
        save the naira.
        He said borrowing money to defend the naira was a bad policy of the previous
        administration that contributed to plunging the local currency into the sorry value it is
        today.
        The chief executive of the Center for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr. Muda
        Yusuf, cited that “The fiscal authorities should continually monitor the economic
        landscape to shape the character of fiscal policy measures to regulate imports in line
        with comparative advantage principles. We need to worry about the risk of import
        surge.
        There is also a need to upscale the use of fiscal policy measures to boost domestic
        production and productivity.
        However, projecting a positive outlook, Dr. Teriba stated that Nigeria will have to deal
        with more specific economic concerns. He said the Central Bank and the Federal
        Government need to do more in terms of trying to attract foreign investments into
        Nigeria.” Looking for exports is not a short-term thing but looking for investments can
        be a short-term thing.
        “Going by the speed at which the Indians pledged more than $14 billion, how are we
        doing with actualizing that? We need to look for who else will be in a position to make
        a commitment to us, and what assets are we putting down to attract foreign
        investments. This is beyond the Central Bank; it’s a countrywide sovereign
        consideration,” he stated.
        He cited that we see what the Saudis are putting down to attract investors; we see
        what the Indians have listed on their India investment grid to attract investors.
        We see what Brazil has listed on their partnership for private investments. These are
        online platforms that they listed as projects they want to fund. And investors are
        engaging and funding them.
        “So, what assets is Nigeria willing to put down; for example, what corporate
        assets? Aramco is in the news listing shares. The government is willing to sell
        $50 billion of Aramco’s shares in Saudi Arabia; Aramco is paying $29 billion in
        dividends. So, which corporate asset is Nigeria willing to push to the market so
        that we could be seen as wanting to put $5 billion in this company or that
        company, not that we want to borrow against output. We could also raise money
        if we list those companies in the stock market.
        “Which real estate project are you willing to free? The National Stadium is there,
        idle. Investors can come in and put money in there and generate income. The
        day their money arrives it’s liquidity for us. When they start generating income,
        it’s income for us as we will get a share. The Federal Secretariat is idle. Is the
        government willing to let investors come and rebuild it into modern offices that
        the private sector will hire and pay the federal government?
        “And what infrastructural assets do we wish to offer investors to put money in?
        So there are corporate assets that the government can take to the market and
        begin to securitize them as assets, real estate can be securitized as assets;
        infrastructure can also be securitized. We build roads and airports all over the
        place. We also have train stations. Which investors could we engage?
        “Many other countries make about half the money they generate from nontransport activities at airports and train stations. We make no such money.
        Investors should be willing to come and capture the indirect benefits of road
        transport at rail stations, airports, seaports, etc. Basically, those are the kinds of
        questions Nigeria needs to confront,” he stated.`,

        title: " How Fola Laoye left her accounting career to balance the sheets in Africa’s health sector",
        content:`Numbers never lie, they say. But barely a few years of crunching numbers Fola
        Laoye decided to leave spreadsheets and go solve the funding woes of the
        healthcare sector.
        More than two decades later, she has spearheaded the attraction of private equity
        investors and development finance institutions into healthcare.
        She has also participated in deals that have been instrumental in raising capital of
        over $100 million in the healthcare sector in Africa to date.
        With the growth of Africa’s population, the healthcare sector is estimated to be worth
        $259 billion by 2030 and has the potential to create 16 million jobs.
        If any sector needs someone to drive access to funding, it would be the Healthcare
        sector and that is what Laoye now represents for the healthcare sector.
        Fola Laoye is now the co-Founder and CEO of Iwosan Investments Limited, the
        Health Investments Holding Company, that now owns Iwosan Lagoon Hospitals, one
        of the leading hospitals in the country.
        Birth and education
        Fola Laoye was born in Lagos state to parents who were both medical doctors. She
        attended Queen’s College Lagos, before proceeding to the University of Lagos
        where she bagged a bachelor’s degree in accounting.
        She worked for a while with Ernst & Young, Lagos before leaving for the United
        Kingdom.
        Rather than toe her parents’ path to becoming a medical doctor, Fola opted for
        accounting. She would recount that the decision to become an accountant stemmed
        from her elder brother.
        “I remember when he was already a qualified accountant, he would pick me up
        and take me to school and I just used to think that being an accountant meant
        being so accomplished, structured, and wealthy. So, I followed in his footsteps
        into accountancy because I did think it was a worthy career and I felt it was a
        skill that I could use” she said.
        She worked with Coopers and Lybrand (now merged into PricewaterhouseCoopers
        PwC) in London for 5 years. While on the job, she did her professional accountancy
        exams (ACA) and got certified.
        She is a Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales, and
        the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria.
        She came to Nigeria briefly after her ACA certification, after which she decided to get
        an MBA in General Management from the Harvard Business School, Cambridge
        USA.
        Pivoting into Healthcare
        While doing her MBA program in the USA, Fola started researching the HMO model
        of health insurance in the US. This would later form the basis of a lot of innovations
        she applied with Hygiea Nigeria Limited, upon her return to Nigeria. Hygiea was a
        private healthcare company set up by her parents.
        In 1999, Laoye joined Hygeia and one of the first responsibilities she handled was
        raising capital.
        “When I joined in 1999, we did one of the first deals with a Direct Foreign
        Investment (DFI) to raise capital for healthcare. It was a small deal (by
        comparison to other sectors) involving about $500,000 at the time, but it was the
        first of its kind. It helped pave the way for more capital to be diverted into
        healthcare, particularly through private equity investments.” she recounted.
        Going into healthcare as an accountant, the target was to attack the issue of access
        to capital in the sector and “build a strong business case to attract more
        funding”.
        The health sector at this point was still in the early stages of adopting health
        insurance, and Hygeia provided a platform for Fola to apply herself to this interest
        after the MBA.
        In 2002, by the age of 32, Fola Laoye had become CEO of Hygeia Nigeria Limited
        and would later serve as Chairperson of the board of Hygeia.
        Under her leadership, Hygeia created access to healthcare for over 1 million
        Nigerians.
        She led the Hygeia HMO team to launch several Health insurance schemes including
        the government’s NHIS, corporate schemes, and community health insurance
        schemes for the urban and rural poor; and these moves attracted international
        subsidy funding.
        From Healthcare private equity
        After almost two decades with Hygeia, Fola Laoye moved into healthcare private
        equity in 2016 as Director of, Investment Fund for Health in Africa.
        Here, she would review investment opportunities within the healthcare landscape
        across Africa.
        After doing this for a couple of years, Fola Laoye founded Health Markets Africa in
        2018 to provide Advisory and Investment Services, still within the Healthcare
        industry.
        The goal, Fola says, is to build healthcare companies and healthcare markets in
        Africa. She has served as the CEO since July 2018.
        In 2015, she also took up the position of Chairperson, of the Old Mutual Life
        Assurance, and still holds this position as confirmed from her LinkedIn Profile.
        The Lagoon Hospital Buyout
        In 2021, Fola Laoye partnered with Fola Adeola to found Iwosan Investments Limited
        – a private healthcare investment company dedicated to investing in the Nigerian
        healthcare market. As stated in the pitchbook, the firm prefers to invest through
        Buyouts and growth capital.
        In 2021, Iwosan Investments Limited acquired Lagoon Hospitals from the Hygeia
        group, and it is now known as Iwosan Lagoon Hospitals.
        Other interests and achievements
        Fola Laoye is a trustee of the Harvard Business School Association of Nigeria
        (HBSAN). She is also a Trustee of the Board of the Society for Quality in Healthcare
        in Nigeria (SQHN) and is also a member of the Board of the Institute of Healthcare
        Improvement (IHI), USA.
        Laoye also sits on several boards – Old Mutual West Africa; PAL Pensions; EchoLab
        Diagnostics, Lifebank Technologies, Results for Development Institute (R4D),
        Washington DC USA; and Harvard Business School’s Healthcare Initiative. She is
        also a Non-Executive Director, at FSDH Asset Management since December 2019.
        In 2011, Fola Laoye was nominated as a Young Global Leader by the World
        Economic Forum. Two years later in 2013, she was awarded the Harvard Business
        School Africa Business Club Leadership Excellence Award.
        Fola enjoys watching football and basketball. She equally likes networking and has
        several interests outside work.
        She is a member of the YPO (Young Presidents Organisation) Lagos Chapterfounder owner reading and has joined wine networks, sports, and music networks via
        the group. She also sits on the Africa Regional Board of YPO.
        Fola has also dabbled into some angel investing, and she says that even though it
        gets risky, she enjoys supporting entrepreneurs as they deploy the capital to make
        the business work.`,

        title: "Bayelsa LNG will be targeting flare sites as feed gas sources in 2024 – Co-founder, Jill Hansen ",
        content:`The current challenge in Nigeria’s natural gas sub-sector lies in feed gas supply,
        largely due to crude oil theft impacting both associated gas and oil production.
        This issue has been emphasized by stakeholders, including Nigeria Liquefied Natural
        Gas (NLNG) Limited, stressing the need for urgent solutions to achieve Nigeria’s
        vision of transitioning into a gas-powered economy across industries, power
        generation, clean cooking, and transportation.
        In a recent conversation, Nairametrics interviewed Jill Hansen, the co-founder of
        Bayelsa LNG, where she discussed the company’s strategy to target gas flare sites
        as potential feed gas sources for their upcoming projects.
        NAIRAMETRICS: What has been happening at Bayelsa LNG as far as
        2023 is concerned?
        Jill Hansen: So far in 2023, Bayelsa LNG has been involved in broad stakeholders’
        engagements with respect to signing multiple Gas Sales/Feedstock agreements,
        engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts as well as the necessary
        government permits and approvals.
        It is expected that the initial phase of the site preparation will begin once the
        commercial and technical feasibility reports for the project are ready before the end
        of next year.
        NAIRAMETRICS: What are your plans at Bayelsa LNG in terms of
        project development and employment creation, for the rest of Q4/2023
        and H1/2024
        Jill Hansen: The last quarter of 2023 will continue to involve broad consultations
        with the major stakeholders in the LNG industry.
        As already highlighted, we are at a critical phase of the project where a lot of
        resources are going into commercial and technical feasibility studies, reports and
        audits.
        We are making sure that proper evaluations of the key components of the project are
        being done. Special attention is given to the social impacts and external effects of the
        project.
        The initial phase of the site preparation activities will begin in 2024 and we are
        optimistic that hundreds of technical and non-technical job opportunities will be
        created between now and the Pre-FID phase of the project.
        NAIRAMETRICS: The Tinubu administration has said that it will focus
        on gas variants as alternatives to the now expensive petrol used for
        powering automobiles and generators in small and large-scale
        businesses. How does Bayelsa LNG plan to tap into this strategy by
        the Federal Government?
        Jill Hansen: We at Bayelsa LNG have long believed that a good proportion of the
        country’s huge natural gas resources should be utilized locally to drive mobility and
        industrialization and we are perfectly positioned to work with the federal government
        of Nigeria in realizing its objectives for domestic gas commercialization and
        utilization.
        Our LNG export project is designed and engineered to also produce a good volume
        of natural gas liquids in addition to the LNG for export.
        The resulting natural gas liquids will be sold domestically in the forms of LPG and
        Propane to address the demand-supply gap in the domestic LPG market and make
        cooking gas more affordable to Nigerian households and commercial users.
        We are also open to selling some volumes of our LNG output in the domestic market
        for power generation and for the automotive industry.
        NAIRAMETRICS: Now that Nigeria has a Minister of State for Gas, the
        LNG market in Nigeria is expected to add more value and grow beyond
        what has obtained in the past. What do you see as the bottlenecks that
        could prevent this anticipated growth in the sector and how can the
        challenges be tackled?
        Jill Hansen: The growth in the domestic LNG market has been stunted by the delay
        in the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act.
        Now that the PIA has become a guiding legislation for activities in the Nigerian oil
        and gas industry, it is important for the government to pay attention to other issues
        such as gas gathering and pipeline infrastructural deficit, low level of investment in
        complementary upstream projects, oil theft and pipeline vandalism as well as
        insecurity. If these challenges can be addressed, we should expect to see more local
        and foreign investments in the Nigerian LNG space.
        NAIRAMETRICS: On a global scale, how would you describe the LNG
        market right now in terms of demand for long-term contracts and the
        spot market as well? How can Nigeria build on these developments
        and increase LNG capacity in the coming years?
        Jill Hansen: The natural gas supply disruptions in Europe as a result of the Russian
        invasion of Ukraine has reshaped the pattern of LNG demand and supply in the
        world.
        The Asian market is traditionally the hotbed for long-term LNG contracts but recordhigh spot prices in the major LNG demand markets in 2022 have forced most
        European nations back to the negotiating table for long-term LNG deals.
        This is especially good for prospective LNG export projects like Bayelsa LNG as
        Europe is geographically at a good shipping distance to Nigerian-based LNG
        projects.
        Also, Europe is banking on Nigerian-based LNG projects as a major replacement for
        the Russian piped gas and this development is a major underpinning for the Bayelsa
        LNG project.
        It is therefore important for the government to create an expedited and investmentfriendly regulatory framework for upcoming LNG export projects in order to take full
        advantage of this new development in the global LNG market.
        NAIRAMETRICS: What are the plans Bayelsa LNG has to tackle gas
        flaring and turn it around for the benefit of the sub-sector?
        Jill Hansen: As an onshore liquefaction facility, Bayelsa LNG is driven by the desire
        to enhance the environmental integrity of Bayelsa State and the Niger Delta region at
        large.
        As part of our ESG and decarbonization goals in 2024, we will be targeting flare sites
        in the state and the region as important sources of feed gas for our LNG facility.
        It is our conviction that our intervention will go a long way in helping to realize the
        objectives of the Nigerian Flare Gas Commercialization Programme.
        NAIRAMETRICS: Give us a brief summary of what Bayelsa LNG is
        doing in local communities in Bayelsa state to tackle environmental
        issues as a result of crude oil theft.
        Jill Hansen: Bayelsa LNG is a project that is borne out of the motive and desire to
        see sustainable socio-economic development in Bayelsa State and the Niger Delta
        region at large.
        The key stakeholders of the project are true indigenes of Bayelsa who have longterm and continuous engagements with the local communities. Bayelsa LNG is a
        project by the people, for the people.
        It is our strong hope that the jobs and economic opportunities that are created at
        Bayelsa LNG will organically begin to reduce illegal theft activity. Bayelsa LNG feels
        strongly about developing the local workforce and talent.
        When presented with more lucrative employment options, career training and wellpaying professional careers in the LNG industry, those participating in oil theft as a
        means of survival will naturally begin to turn away from illegal business.
        Capacity building will help to empower the youths, women and vulnerable members
        of those communities to take responsibility and lend their voice to the call against
        crude oil theft and environmental degradation.
        Bayelsa LNG also has a commitment to maintaining and preserving the mangroves
        and delta wetlands that are so vital to the environment.
        This commitment will be manifested by reforestation and conservation programs.
        NAIRAMETRICS: Does Bayelsa LNG have any ongoing agreements
        with the NLNG, if not, are there any plans to do so? Can you share
        details?
        Jill Hansen: As earlier mentioned, Bayelsa LNG is broadly engaging the major
        stakeholders in the industry. We highly regard what NLNG has achieved globally, and
        we will definitely be happy to explore areas of common interest.
        However, we are currently focusing on government approvals, multiple feedstock
        agreements and EPC contracts and our progress report at every phase of the project
        will always be made available to the public.
        NAIRAMETRICS: How do you see the current economic downturn
        (inflation rate: 26.72%) and insecurity in Nigeria affecting LNG
        investments in the country going forward?
        Jill Hansen: The recent inflation figures are remarkable especially if we consider the
        effects on the domestic capital market. It is also important that the nation is safe
        enough for investments in the thriving LNG sub-sector.
        However, NLNG has been able to sustain operations and remain competitive since
        its inception despite the historically high level of insecurity, especially in the past
        years.
        For Bayelsa LNG, we believe that our strong social interactions, community service
        and acceptance among the local communities of Bayelsa State will make us worry

        NAIRAMETRICS: How about the current rise in global crude oil prices?
        Does this have any impact on Nigeria’s LNG business?
        Jill Hansen: The LNG export industry is global. Major movements in international
        crude oil prices are bound to create a ripple effect in the global energy market,
        including the LNG market.
        Most of the long-term LNG contracts in the major demand markets of the world are
        indexed to crude oil prices such as the Brent Crude and Japanese Crude Oil Cocktail
        (JCC) and a rise in crude oil prices is expected to impact new long-term LNG deals
        even for the Nigerian-based LNG projects.`,

        title: "UBA’s impressive ROAE reflects profitability, efficiency, and boosts investor confidence ",
        content:`In its 9-month financial results for 2023, UBA achieved 125% year-over-year growth
        in return on average equity, reaching 44.37%.
        Combined with a return on average assets of 4.42% and a year-to-date share price
        gain of 173%, the highest in the banking sector, it reflects improved profitability and
        efficiency, and is likely to sustain positive investor sentiment.
        UBA’s impressive ROAE AND ROAA indicate that shareholders are realizing a
        significant return on their investment in assets or equity.
        The bank attributed this performance to the growth in profit before tax. The Group
        Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Oliver Alawuba, commenting on the
        Group’s Q3 results said:
        “I am particularly excited by the 263% YoY growth in profit before tax, which has
        helped to drive increased returns to shareholders, with a 44.4% ROAE,
        compared to 19.7% achieved as of December 2022.”
        Additionally, UBA reported an outstanding 287.18% YoY growth in profit after tax,
        reaching N449.296 billion, making it the leader in the banking sector in terms of
        profitability.
        The bank also explained that the bottom-line performance is founded on continuous
        improvement and growth in gross earnings and balance sheet size.
        While the bank’s gross earnings grew by 115% year-on-year to N1.309 trillion, total
        assets went up by 49% to N16.236 trillion from N10.9 trillion as of December 2022.
        It also highlighted that the growth in gross earnings was driven by 56.8% growth in
        net interest income and 3.36x growth in non-interest revenue.
        However, it is important to note that the non-interest income, driven by FX gains, may
        experience a decline, given the 92% successive quarter drop observed in Q3.
        In Q3, the bank reported foreign exchange gains of N31.975 billion, a notable
        decrease compared to the impressive N418.278 billion recorded in the first half of
        2023.
        This decline in FX gains had a moderating effect on net trading and foreign exchange
        income, resulting in a total of N450.253 billion for the first nine months of 2023.
        This expected decline could have an effect on both the top line and bottom line in
        subsequent periods. Notwithstanding, the 9M performance may see the bank
        exceed its 2023 provided guidance and is likely to enhance investor confidence.
        In 2022 full year, the bank recorded 19.7% and 1.76% return on average equity and
        return on average assets respectively.
        For the 2023 full year, it aimed to achieve a 20% return on average equity and
        2%return on average assets. With the 9M return on average equity of 44.37% and
        return on average of 4.42%, the bank is set to exceed its guidance, despite the
        expected revenue shortfall due to a decline in FX gains.
        Moreover, the bank’s 9M financials highlight robust midline performance, specifically
        in its key lending operations, with an 11% YoY growth in net interest income after
        impairment charges and a 5.2% increase in net interest margin.
        This suggests that the bank is earning a higher proportion of income from its interestearning assets. In alignment with this observation, the bank explained that the
        material increase in net interest income was on the back of a 47.6% expansion in the
        bank’s interest-earning assets.
        This achievement becomes even more noteworthy, considering the bank’s more
        conservative approach in provisioning for potential losses as reflected in the
        substantial 964% year-over-year growth in impairment losses, which reflected in the
        498.7% increase in cost of risk to 4.07% in 9M.
        Also, operational expenses were well-managed, evidenced by a 42% year-on-year
        decrease in the cost-to-income ratio to 36.44%. This control is crucial for sustaining
        favourable returns to shareholders.
        UBA’s earnings per share (EPS) saw significant growth, reaching N12.93 for the nine
        months, a 294% increase year-on-year, and a trailing twelve-month EPS of N14.49.
        Q3 alone registered an EPS of N3.27, marking a 108.28% growth over the period.
        With a year-to-date share price gain of 173%, the share price outpaces earnings,
        reflecting strong investor sentiment.
        Currently, UBA’s stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 6.75%, higher than the
        average peer dividend yield of 4.5%. This implies that, based on the current stock
        price, investors could potentially earn a return of 6.75% through dividends.
        UBA’s stock is currently priced attractively compared to its industry peers. With a
        Price-To-Earnings Ratio (P/E) of 1.4x, well below the peer average of 4.02x.
        Additionally, the price-to-sales ratio of 0.30 indicates a market perception of
        undervaluation, reinforcing the idea that UBA’s stock is considered underpriced
        relative to its revenue.
        With a strong return to shareholders highlighted by the bank’s impressive return on
        average equity and a robust total return of 179.75% represented by the combination
        of share price year-to-date gain and dividend yield, UBA appears as a compelling
        investment opportunity
        To sustain this appeal UBA must continue to be resilient and committed to delivering
        value and enhancing the confidence of its customers, stakeholders and the wider
        public, notwithstanding the competitive landscape and current global trend in the
        industry.`,

        title: "Nigerian banks earn big as loan book jumps by N8.5 trillion in nine months ",
        content:`Major Nigerian banks on the Nigerian stock exchange reported bumper interest
        income in the first nine months of 2023 as their aggregate loan books grew by N8.45
        trillion between January and September 2023.
        This is according to data compiled by Nairalytics from the unaudited financial
        statements of the banks. Specifically, the ten commercial banks that have released
        their Q3 financials as of press time, saw their loans to customers increase from
        N22.66 trillion recorded as of December 2022 to N31.1 trillion by the end of
        September 2023.
        This translates to a 37.3% increase in the review period. Customer deposits also
        surged by N18.6 trillion in the same period to N61.99 trillion in contrast to N43.37
        trillion recorded as of December 2023.
        In the same vein, interest income witnessed a significant boost to the tune of N4.18
        trillion, a 65.9% increase from N2.48 trillion recorded in the corresponding period of
        2022.
        Net profit also surged by 153% year-on-year to N1.93 trillion in the 9-month period of
        2023 from N762.6 billion recorded in the previous year. 
        It is however worth noting that a significant portion of the net income will not be paid
        as dividends to shareholders, following the CBN directive to banks not to pay
        dividends from FX revaluation gains.
        Why the robust performance
        The significant increase in the banks’ balance sheet is largely attributed to the impact
        of the devaluation of the official exchange rate.
        Recall that the CBN announced the floating of the naira at the official Investors and
        Exporters window (IEFX), which saw the official rate depreciate from an average of
        N465/$ to around N750/$.
        The floating of the exchange rate implies that the balance sheets of banks will
        remain responsive to the dynamics of the exchange rate market due to their
        foreign assets and liabilities, which include deposits, debts, and loans extended
        to customers.
        Notably, the naira depreciated by 39% between January and September 2023
        and has continued to trend downwards, trading as high as N1,100/$ in recent
        weeks. This implies that banks could see a further surge in their balance sheet
        before the end of the year.
        In addition to the impact of FX revaluation on loans and interest income, banks
        have also enjoyed increased revenue as a result of the high-interest rate
        environment. The apex bank has maintained a tight monetary policy since 2022
        in a bid to rein on inflation, which has remained sticky high all through the year.
        The CBN’s benchmark interest rate increased from 16.5% in December last year
        to a record high of 18.75% in September 2023, while the prime lending rate
        stood at 14.32% from 13.85% in the reference period.
        Banks with the highest customer loan growth
        UBA recorded the highest growth rate in terms of loans to customers, growing its
        loan book by 57% to N3.14 trillion, while Zenith Bank led the list in terms of nominal
        growth, with an increase of N1.9 trillion to stand at N5.78 trillion as of September
        2023.
        Meanwhile, Access Bank maintained the top spot as the bank with the highest loans
        to customers, which was N6.7 trillion as of the review period, representing a 31%
        increase from N5.1 trillion recorded as of December 2023.
        It is worth adding that all the banks saw their loans to customers increase in the
        period under review except for Unity Bank, which declined by 23% to stand at
        N222.79 billion from N289.36 billion as of the beginning of the year.
        Banks with the highest interest income
        Access Bank recorded the highest interest income among the listed banks, posting a
        total interest income of N1.04 trillion. Zenith Bank and UBA followed in second and
        third spots with income of N670.9 billion and N666.3 billion respectively.
        GTCo recorded an interest income of N374.6 billion, while Fidelity Bank earned
        N324.8 billion. On the flip side, Unity Bank recorded the least with N33 billion`,

        title: "Zenith Bank’s loan loss strategy is in its best interest ",
        content:`In its 9-month financial results for 2023, Zenith Bank recorded a remarkable pre-tax
        profit growth of 149.05% year-over-year, totalling N505.036 billion, the highest in
        Nigeria for this period.
        A significant factor in this performance was the substantial foreign exchange gains
        due to the Naira’s devaluation from ₦461.1/$ at the end of 2022 to ₦776.8/$ by
        September 2023.
        Zenith Bank’s foreign exchange gains reached N378.122 billion in the nine months,
        with N354.376 billion in Q2 alone.
        However, a decrease to N22.534 billion in Q3 moderated these gains.
        While Q2 saw peak quarterly gross earnings and post-tax profit, contributing to the
        nine-month performance, there’s more to consider.
        Interest income increased by 72% to N670.932 billion, but interest expenses grew
        more sharply by 137% to N255.704 billion.
        Zenith Bank also provided some context to their recent earnings explaining that it
        was largely due to new loans as well as forex revaluation’
        “The growth in profit similarly is attributable to the twin effects of the
        improvement in interest and non-interest income. Interest income increased
        because of the growth in risk assets as well as the effective pricing thereon. The
        non-interest income growth is largely driven by the revaluation gain due to the
        unification of exchange rates during the year.”
        Despite this, net interest income rose by 47% to N415.228 billion. However, a
        16.51% decline in net interest income after impairment charges and a 10% drop in
        net interest margin to 5.6% were noted.
        A spike in loan impairment charges to N209.999 billion, a 466% year-on-year
        increase, significantly affected the cost of risk, which jumped by 323% to 5.5%,
        indicating higher credit risk and impacting the net interest income margin.
        The bank explained that the rising loan impairment was strategic as it preferred to
        take the hit on loan losses now that profits are at all-time highs. 
        “Impairment levels increased due to the deliberate incremental provisions
        necessitated by our conservative approach towards the heightened risk
        environment and the creation of a counter-cyclical buffer needed to deal with any
        impending volatility of exchange rates.”
        “This caused the cost of risk to deteriorate from 1.3% in Q3 2022 to 5.5% in Q3
        2023, however, this is an improvement from Q2 2023 where cost of risk printed
        at 8.8% because of prudent management of our risk assets.”
        However, Zenith Bank’s effective credit quality management also seems to be
        working as evidenced in the reduced non-performing loan ratio to 3.8% and a
        substantial decline in loan impairment charges in Q3 to N2 million.
        Additionally, the bank demonstrated strong shareholder returns, with a 95% growth in
        return on average equity to 35.1% and a return on average assets of 3.5%.
        These figures highlight the bank’s efficiency in profit generation from shareholders’
        funds and assets.
        Operational expenses were well-managed, evidenced by a 32% year-on-year
        decrease in the cost-to-income ratio to 37.8%. This control is crucial for sustaining
        favourable returns to shareholders.
        Zenith Bank’s earnings per share (EPS) saw significant growth, reaching N13.82 for
        the nine months, a 149.05% increase year-on-year, and a trailing twelve-month EPS
        of N14.17.
        Q3 alone registered an EPS of N3.29, marking a 107% growth over the period. With
        a year-to-date share price gain of 38.73%, earnings outpace the share price, driving
        its upward trend.
        The Central Bank of Nigeria’s directive limiting the use of FX gains for dividends and
        expenses tempers expectations for higher returns in 2023. Still, Zenith Bank’s solid
        dividend history and an interim dividend of N0.50 for H1 2023 keep investor interest
        alive.
        Currently, Zenith Bank’s stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 10.21% and the
        highest EPS among the five Tier-1 banks.
        Its trailing twelve-month P/E of 2.16x is below the Tier-1 banks’ average of 2.37x,
        and a price-to-sales ratio of 0.83 suggests a market perception of undervaluation.
        Despite these promising valuation metrics, reversing the decline in net interest
        income remains crucial for Zenith Bank, especially as FX gains, a key bottom-line
        driver in 2023, diminish.`,

        title: " Nigerian Banks generated N265.269 billion from electronic businesses in 9Months",
        content:`Nigerian banks continued to leverage fintech in the nine months of 2023, generating
        a total revenue of N265.269 billion from their electronic businesses.
        This represents a 24.42% increase from the N213.204 billion recorded in the
        previous period of 2022.
        The top two earners, in terms of e-business income, were Access Holdings Plc and
        United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA). Access Holdings earned N70.350 billion while UBA
        generated N61.161 billion.
        Other top earners included FBNH, Zenith Bank Plc, and GTCO.
        In addition to the growth in e-business income, These Nigerian banks also reported
        strong profit before tax of N2.339 trillion in the nine months of 2023. This represents
        a 160% increase from the N899.925 billion recorded in the same period of 2022.
        The strong growth in e-business revenue is a testament to the increasing adoption of
        fintech solutions in Nigeria.
        Fintech is transforming the financial services landscape in the country, making it
        more accessible, convenient, and affordable for individuals and businesses alike.
        The banks’ nine months of e-business earnings are a clear indication that FinTech is
        having a significant impact on the Nigerian financial sector.
        Banks are investing heavily in fintech to improve their product and service offerings,
        and to meet the growing demand for digital financial services.
        The growth in e-business income was driven by the increasing popularity of mobile
        and online banking in Nigeria. As more and more people use these channels to
        access financial services, banks are seeing a corresponding increase in revenue.
        E-business income includes revenue from electronic channels, card products, and
        related services. These channels include mobile applications, USSD channels,
        automated teller machines (ATMs), agency banking, internet banking, and point of
        sales (POS) payments.
        The growth in e-business income is a positive sign for the Nigerian banking sector. It
        shows that banks are adapting to the changing needs of customers and are wellpositioned to benefit from the growth of the digital economy.
        The Impact of Fintech on the Financial Services Landscape 
        Fintech companies are using technology to provide financial services that are more
        convenient, affordable, and accessible to consumers and businesses.
        One of the most significant impacts of fintech is the increase in financial inclusion.
        Fintech companies can reach people who were previously unbanked or underbanked
        by providing services that can be accessed through mobile phones.
        This has led to a significant increase in the number of people who have access to
        financial services in Nigeria.
        Another impact of fintech is the growth in the volume of financial transactions.
        Fintech companies have made it easier and more convenient for people to make
        payments, transfer money, and invest their money. This has led to a significant
        increase in the volume of financial transactions in Nigeria.
        The entrance of telecoms into the financial services sector has also had a significant
        impact. Telecom companies have the infrastructure to reach people in rural areas,
        where traditional banks are often not present. This has made it possible for more
        people in rural areas to access financial services.
        Fintech is also having an impact on the way that banks operate. Banks are
        increasingly using fintech solutions to improve their efficiency and reduce their costs.
        This has led to an increase in non-interest income for banks, as they can generate
        more revenue from commissions and fees.
        More details on the banks’ e-business performance in 9 months
        Analysis of data collated by Nairametrics from the financial statements of eleven
        listed banks shows that tier-1 banks such as UBA, Access Bank, First Bank GT
        Bank, and Zenith Bank led the list of banks with the highest e-business income in the
        past nine months of 2023.
        These banks recorded a combined sum of N244.757 billion from electronic business
        as against N198.110 billion in 2022. This sum represents 92.26% of the total sum of
        N244.757 billion generated in the nine months of 2023.
        Also, the banks recorded a pretax profit of N2.005 trillion in the period, an increase of
        162.68% from the N763.314 billion posted during the quarter. The amount also
        accounts for 85.69% of the total pretax profits recorded by the banks.
        GTCO Holdings – N21.216 billion 
        GTCO Holdings reported an e-business income of N30.906 billion, representing
        an increase of 14.7%, compared to N26.945 billion generated in the equivalent
        period the previous year.
        The holding company accounted for 11.65% of the total income generated by the
        eleven banks from electronic banking.
        GTCO Holding, the parent group of GT Bank recorded a nine-month profit before
        tax of N433.2 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 155.2% from the
        same period in 2022. The group also recorded a profit after tax of N367.4 billion
        during the nine months, representing a year-on-year increase of 181.9% from
        the corresponding period last year.
        The group recorded a net interest income of N297.5 billion during the nine
        months, representing a year-on-year increase of 56.9% from last year’s figure.
        The lender’s foreign exchange revaluation gains also appreciated significantly as
        it moved from a loss position of N7.39 billion as of September 2022 to a gain of
        N334.35 billion.
        Zenith Bank – N33.551 billion 
        Zenith Bank Plc posted an e-business income of N33.551 billion during the first
        nine months of 2023, a decrease of 6.98% compared to N36.069 billion recorded
        in the corresponding period of 2022.
        The most capitalized bank on the NGX, accounted for 12.65% of the total ebusiness income by the eleven banks.
        Zenith Bank generated the highest profit with a pre-tax profit of N505 billion in
        the nine months ending September 2023.
        The company recorded a significant surge from the N202.5 billion reported
        during the corresponding period last year.
        In only nine months, the group has already surpassed its 2022 earnings. For
        instance, in 2022, Zenith Bank made N284.7 billion in profit before tax, but in the
        first nine months of 2023, the group’s profit after tax had already reached N434.2
        billion.
        FBNH– N48.789 billion 
        First Bank’s e-business revenue grew by 22.04% in the nine months of 2023 to
        stand at N48.789 billion from N39.977 billion recorded in 2022.
        However, the bank’s e-business income accounted for 18.39% of the e-business
        revenue captured.
        The Group’s profit before tax was up 156.3% to N270.3 billion from N105.5
        billion posted in 2022, driven by strong growth in interest income.
        According to the group’s financial statements for nine months, the company’s
        profit after tax (PAT) was N236.4 billion, a 159,2% increase from the N91.2
        billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2022
        The group reported gross earnings of N922.2 billion, up 80.1% y-o-y from
        N547.2 billion recorded in 2022.
        The company posted a net interest income of N377.0 billion, up 51.4% y-o-y as
        against N249.5 billion recorded in 2022.
        The group’s non-interest income stood at N326.9 billion, up 108% y-o-y from
        (Sep 2022: N157 billion).
        Operating expenses were N352.3 billion, up 33.3% y-o-y (Sep 2022: N264.3
        billion).
        UBA – N61.161 billion 
        The Pan African bank recorded a sum of N61.161 billion as e-business income
        during the first nine months of the year 2023, an increase of 33.77% compared
        to N45.720 billion recorded in the previous year.
        The bank accounted for 23.06% of the total e-business income realized by the
        eleven banks.
        UBA recorded a profit before tax of N502.1 billion, marking a year-on-year
        increase of 262.5% from the corresponding period last year.
        The bank also recorded a profit after tax of N449.3 billion during the nine
        months, marking a year-on-year surge of 287.2% from the corresponding period
        last year.
        UBA has been one of the major beneficiaries of rising interest rates in Nigeria, as
        it has led to rising interest income for the bank.
        Access Holdings – N70.350 billion 
        Access Holdings Plc, which is the largest commercial bank in the country,
        generated N70.350 billion from its electronic business, a 42.41% increase from
        N49.399 billion generated a year earlier.
        This accounted for 26.52% of the total amount generated by the eleven banks
        under consideration.
        Access Holdings has an impressive number with a nine-month pre-tax profit of
        N294.4 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 100.2% from the
        corresponding period last year.
        The group’s profit after tax of N250.4 billion during the nine months was also an
        83% year-on-year increase from the same period in 2022.
        The increase in profits, as declared on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), is
        driven by an 84% increase in interest income to N1.05 trillion in nine months of
        2023 from N571.74 billion reported in nine months of 2022 and N208.18 billion
        fees and commission in nine months of 2023, representing an increase of 56%
        from N133.49 billion reported in nine months of 2022.
        Access Holdings also witnessed a significant 37% year-to-date growth in
        customer deposits, concluding the nine months at a commendable N12.75
        trillion.
        Others include
        Sterling Financial Holdings N6.304 billion
        Wema Bank – N5.207 billion
        Stanbic IBTC- N3.242 billion

        title: "Six years after N5.8bn reconstruction, cracks rock Abuja Airport taxiway ",
        content:`Six years after the Federal Government through the Ministry of Aviation
        reconstructed the runway of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA) Abuja,
        Nairametrics can confirm that its taxiway is riddled with cracks, thereby endangering
        the users.
        The then Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika had shut down the airport for six
        weeks for the total reconstruction of the only runway at the airport.
        Sirika had claimed that it cost the government about N5.8 billion to carry out the
        massive repairs.
        But, Nairametrics learnt that the taxiway had almost collapsed six years later.
        Runway lifespan
        The standard lifespan of a runway and taxiway is between 30 to 40 years, especially
        for busy airports.
        The poor situation of the taxiway led to a serious incident with the Aero Contractors
        Boeing 737 aircraft on Sunday while the aircraft was taxiing out of the runway.
        Commenting on the issue, the Chief Executive Officer, Centurion Securities Limited,
        Grp. John Ojikutu (retd), said that the taxiway like the runway lacked period
        maintenance as required.
        Lack of maintenance
        According to him, maintenance on the runways and taxiways is expected to be
        carried out at least yearly, wondering if this had been done since the runway was
        reconstructed in the first quarter of 2017.
        He explained that the repairs, which were carried out by Julius Berger in 2017 were
        the first of its kind since the runway was built over 30 years ago and queried the
        quality of the repair done in less than two months.
        He said: “There are expected to be periodic maintenance on the runways after a
        certain number of landings yearly. How many times have these been done?
        Secondly, the repairs done in 2017 by Julius Berge were the first of its kind since
        the runway was built over 30 thirty years ago before then. What was the quality
        of the repair done in less than two months?
        Julius Berge did the construction; it also did the repairs, we need to put the
        questions of the quality on the toes of the construction firm. Cracks would come
        based on the quality of construction, landings, repairs and the periodic
        maintenance done on the runways.”
        Also, Mr. Cyril Obuah, an aviation analyst, said the current state of the taxiway was
        due to poor quality work executed by the Federal Government in 2017.
        Taxiway not repaired
        Also, a former pilot with the defunct Nigeria Airways, Capt. Mohammed Badamasi
        said that the runway and the taxiway are two different entities.
        He expressed that while the government carried out a reconstruction of the runway
        with billions of naira, it failed to carry out repairs on the taxiway.
        He regretted that since the official opening of the airport, the taxiway and apron,
        where the aircraft are parked, have never had a facelift.
        He emphasised that Abuja airport, which is over 40 years old, its taxiway surfaces
        ought to have been rebuilt by the government.
        “See what it looks like, as if it is not being managed by people trained to know
        what is required for the safety of aircraft movements. There are so many things
        wrong with the airport in Abuja.
        “Remember that I mentioned the status of the taxiway. No taxi lights to help the
        pilots to navigate taxi routes. These are my observations on many occasions in
        my journey to Abuja, of which the recent one was in September this year,” he
        said.
        Badamasi further observed that the tarmac fingers were not being used for domestic
        flights by airlines, maintaining that the exit used by passengers to the aircraft was not
        safe, pointing out that it was below the standard required for the safety of
        passengers.
        He warned that in case of an emergency, many travellers and other users would be
        seriously injured, because of the metal stairway, made of solid metal.
        He declared that the nation’s airports needed managers who understood safety in
        the system and doubted if there were competent personnel to effectively carry out
        this function.
        Serious incident due to poor taxiway
        An Aero Contractors aircraft, a B737 aircraft with the registration number: 5N-BYQ,
        had on Sunday morning been involved in a serious incident at the Abuja airport due
        to a nose wheel stuck in the grass verge of the taxiway with its fuselage on the
        runway.
        The serious incident led to the closure of the runway before the aircraft was towed
        out of the runway.
        N5.8bn repairs
        Sirika had said in January 2017 that the proposed repair of the Abuja airport runway
        would cost N5.8 billion.
        He said the runway had become necessary in view of the fact that it was as critical
        as the economy of the country, adding that the runway was constructed over 30
        years ago with no major repairs.
        The minister gave a guarantee of 10 years, saying that the runway would serve the
        country for a long time after the repair`,

        title: "Inside the Panama Canal restriction and its impact on Nigeria’s cooking gas supplies ",
        content:`The Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited recently said that vessel scarcity
        due to the restrictions at the Panama Canal was one of the reasons for the rise in the
        cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) also known as cooking gas.
        The company also said other factors include oil prices and foreign exchange crisis.
        According to NLNG, vessel scarcity due to the Panama Canal situation has given
        rise to increased shipping costs which reflect on the cost for end users. There are
        now indications that the situation will get worse which will further exacerbate rising
        LPG costs for Nigerians.
        Recall that Nigeria still depends on LPG imports for 60% of demand as the NLNG is
        only able to meet 40%.
        Insights on Panama Canal Restrictions
        The Panama Canal is grappling with an unprecedented drought, potentially
        intensified by El Nino and climate change. Gatun Lake, crucial for the canal, is
        experiencing record-low water levels, leading to progressively stricter restrictions on
        ship transits. Here’s a breakdown of the situation:
        Drought Intensified by El Nino and Climate Change – The Gatun Lake, a key
        water source for the canal, records levels below 80 feet. El Nino’s warming
        effects on the Pacific Ocean exacerbate the drought. Meanwhile, global sea
        surface temperatures hit a record high in 2023, contributing to the crisis.
        Canal Authority’s Response – Restrictions on ship transits tightened due to water
        scarcity. Average daily transits reduced from 32 to 31 ships from November 1,
        further decreasing in the coming months.
        Impact on Shipping and Freight Costs – Analysts warn of potential long queues
        causing higher freight costs. Ship operators may charge more or opt for longer
        routes due to limited canal access.
        Restriction Timeline – Compared to about 38 to 40 transits daily, they are now to
        decrease gradually: 31 from November 1, 25 from November 3, 24 from
        November 7, 22 from December 1, 20 from January 1, 2024, and 18 from
        February 1, 2024.
        Additional Water-Saving Measures – The Panama Canal implements various
        measures, including water reuse, simultaneous crossings, and schedule
        optimization to address the prolonged drought and ensure efficient canal
        operations.
        Natural gas analyst, Kayode Oluwadare told Nairametrics that since its inception, the
        Panama Canal has been an important man-made maritime route for dry and wet
        cargo vessels.
        Since its completion in 1914, the 80-kilometer waterway has continued to promote
        international trade especially between the United States and the Asian countries as it
        connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean.
        He also noted that the canal has also been an important route for the movement of
        large oil and gas vessels such as VLGC and VLCC. In recent years, the water level
        at the Panama Canal has dropped significantly largely due to drought.
        He said:
        “This has negatively affected the smooth passage of vessels including those of
        crude oil, LPG, LNG, and other commodities, resulting in long queues of vessels
        waiting to use the canal and unusually long waiting times.
        “This is causing a major disruption to normal shipping schedules across the
        globe as activities around the waterway affect over 60% of global seaborne
        trade. The disruption at the Panama Canal has played a major role in the rising
        LPG prices currently being felt across the country.
        “Most vessels including the LPG vessels, that have to use the canal are having
        to either pay a premium through an auction to jump to the front of the line, spend
        additional days or weeks on the long queues, or resort to a longer route such as
        the Cape of Good Hope all in a bid to beat the long queues. All these endeavors
        result in high shipping and insurance costs which have to be borne ultimately by
        the end users of LPG upon import.”
        More Insights on the Nigeria-Panama Canal Connection
        The use of the Panama Canal in the Nigerian context has mostly been for the
        transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the NLNG’s Bonny facility to the
        South American buyers and this activity dates back to the commencement of
        operations at the plant between 1999 and 2000.
        Most of the LNG deliveries from Nigeria to South America are on a cost, insurance,
        and freight (CIF) basis while the LPG is sold on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.
        The Panama Canal has also been used for dry bulk shipping from Nigeria to South
        America and the Asia-Pacific region.
        It is also important to note that imported LPG volumes are not necessarily from
        locations and regions around the Panama Canal as large volumes are sourced even
        from neighboring African countries.
        However, the congestion at the canal is contributing to the scarcity of vessels needed
        for the transportation of commodities including LPG amidst global challenges around
        rising costs and inflation.
        It then requires a premium to charter a vessel among the pool of the limited number
        of vessels available for voyage charter.
        This cost will eventually be passed to the end users of LPG on the streets of Lagos,
        Enugu, Kaduna, and other locations within the country.
        Brace up for higher costs
        As earlier noted, it is expected that LPG prices will rise further as the situation around
        the Panama Canal is not expected to improve in the short to medium term.
        Other factors that are driving the spike in domestic LPG prices such as exchange
        rate volatility and the uncertainty around the global crude oil prices to which LPG
        prices are indexed, are still active.
        Meanwhile, the high winter demand for LPG in Europe and parts of Asia is also
        expected to keep upward pressure on international LPG prices.
        Nigerians should brace up for record-high LPG prices between now and the end of
        2023.
        Already, end users across the country are refilling their cooking gas canisters for
        above N1,200 per kilogram.
        With the yuletide season fast approaching and with the restrictions at the Panama
        Canal getting even tighter, some analysts project cooking gas might cost up to
        N1500 per kilogram at Christmas`,

        title: "NGX: New listings contribute over 10% to market capitalization in 2 years",
        content:`Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has said that new listings on the NGX have
        contributed over 10% of market capitalization in the last two years.
        NGX Chief Executive Officer, Temi Popoola stated this at the MTN Capital Markets
        Day in Abuja while speaking on the global challenge faced by exchanges with
        increasing delistings.  
        “Nigerian Exchange Limited experienced a remarkable surge in market
        capitalization, with new listings contributing over 10% in the past two years,
        according to data released by the Exchange. 
        This underscores NGX’s growing prominence as a preferred destination for
        corporate listings and capital raising. 
        “There has been quite a bit of news lately about delistings in our market, and
        that is a trend we are seeing not just in Nigeria but on major exchanges globally. Take Johannesburg, for instance; it has been struggling with delistings,” he
        said. 
        Initial Public Offerings
        Popoola noted that globally, Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) have witnessed a
        slowdown of more than 60% in the last two years, according to market data provider
        PitchBook.
        “Additionally, there has been a noticeable scarcity of smaller cap stocks on
        public exchanges due to various factors such as voluntary and involuntary
        delistings, mergers and acquisitions, and liquidations,” he said. 
        NGX’s strategy to replace delistings
        While commenting on the shift of capital from public markets to private ones,
        especially among smaller companies, Popoola emphasized NGX’s strategy to
        replace delistings faster than they occur.
        “What most exchanges aim to do is replace those delistings faster than they
        occur, and that has formed the crux of our strategy at NGX. 
        We have had notable listings within the last two years including BUA Foods,
        Geregu – which is our first power sector listing, MeCure Industries, VFD Group,
        and interestingly our first listed Investment Trust, Nigeria Infrastructure Debt
        Fund,” he said
        Government advocacy and policymaking
        Addressing potential solutions, Popoola stressed the significance of government
        advocacy and policymaking.
         Drawing on historical examples, he highlighted the transformative impact of
        government interventions through policy changes, citing the banking sector and
        pension reforms of 2004 as notable instances that have positively influenced market
        growth.
        “As NGX continues to position itself as a dynamic and resilient exchange, the
        commitment to proactive strategies and collaboration with government initiatives
        remains at the forefront”, Popoola noted.`,

        title: "Is Total Energies’ share price rally supported by its earnings?",
        content:`Total Energies Marketing Plc witnessed a 1.22% decline in pre-tax profit in 2022,
        contrasting with its 5-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +15.15%.
        The share price also underperformed against the NGX All-Share Index (NGXASI),
        with a -13.02% year-to-date (YtD) return, while NGXASI grew by 19.98%.
        Despite this, Total’s share price has surged by 99.5% YtD in 2023, ranking it 43rd
        among the best-performing stocks on the NGX in terms of YtD share price
        appreciation.
        However, this rise in share price contrasts with a 13.47% decrease in earnings per
        share in the first nine months of 2023, raising questions about the sustainability of
        this growth.
        The Nigerian economy’s changes, including naira devaluation and removal of fuel
        subsidies, have significantly impacted businesses and sectors like oil and gas, where
        Total operates.
        The oil and gas sector index, featuring companies like Conoil, Eterna, MRS Oil,
        Seplat, and Total Energies, has shown a remarkable YtD growth of 106.37%,
        outpacing the broader ASI’s growth of 37.78%.
        Investors seem to be driving Total Energies’ share price growth, banking on the
        sector’s positive outlook, despite the company’s earnings decline.
        Total’s historical financial performance, with consistent double-digit CAGR in profits,
        supports this optimism. In 2023’s first half, Total showed a 6% growth in pre-tax profit
        and a 3% increase in EPS, driven by a 31.38% year-on-year revenue growth.
        Its Q3 revenue reached a record N147.974 billion, contributing to a 9-month revenue
        of N422.576 billion.
        However, challenges like increased costs, foreign exchange losses, and rising
        interest expenses have impacted the bottom line.
        Total incurred a N4.805 billion foreign exchange loss in Q3, and interest expenses
        related to imports and loans increased by 63.12% year-on-year. These factors led to
        an 11.51% decrease in pre-tax profit for the first nine months of 2023.
        Despite this, Total’s Q4 2022 pre-tax profit was N6.006 billion, and it projects a
        conservative N2.311 billion for Q4 2023. The Q3 2023 pre-tax profit drop to N3.145
        billion, compared to higher figures in Q1 and Q2, adds to the challenge of surpassing
        its full-year 2022 pre-tax profit.
        Stock prices are sensitive to earnings. A shortfall in earnings compared to historical
        trends or market expectations could lead to a stock price decline.
        Total’s consistent dividend payments and the sector’s highest dividend yield of 6.49%
        may not offset concerns about earnings sustainability, potentially leading to a sell-off
        by investors seeking stable dividends.
        For the 2022 financial year, Total declared an interim dividend of N4. No interim
        dividend has been announced for 2023, reflecting caution or response to financial
        challenges. 
        Despite these issues, Total’s sustained revenue growth and reduced cost of sales
        and operating expenses offer hope for future financial improvement`,

        content:`In the dynamic landscape of Nigeria’s financial sector, payment switching and
        processing companies play a pivotal role in enabling seamless digital transactions
        and fostering financial inclusion.
        These companies act as intermediaries, routing and processing payments between
        various entities, including banks, merchants, and consumers.
        Their operations underpin the burgeoning digital economy, driving innovation and
        expanding access to financial services, hence, it is not surprising that Under the CBN
        payment framework, the switching license is the highest awarded to any fintech by
        the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
        What is a payment switch?
        A payment switch is a company that connects financial institutions to enable the flow

        title: "Meet the Nigerian Fashion Moguls championing ‘Made in Africa’ worldwide",
        content:`In a recent update to a 2019 report, Nigeria’s growing fashion industry has been
        appraised at approximately $4.7 billion, constituting 15% of the overall Sub-Saharan
        market value, estimated at $31 billion, according to data from Euromonitor.
        As the “textile, apparel, and footwear” sector experiences substantial growth,
        propelled by increasing demand and forward-thinking initiatives such as Lagos
        Fashion Week and GTCo Fashion Week, Lagos has emerged as a pivotal hub for
        the Nigerian Fashion Industry.
        In the first half of 2023, the sector played a significant role in the manufacturing
        landscape, contributing N2.76 trillion, accounting for 17.7% of the total manufacturing
        value, and an impressive 51.2% of the overall value generated, reaching a total of
        N5.4 trillion for the year.
        Harnessing the power of social media, Nigerian fashion has gained global
        prominence, spotlighting innovation and creativity that cements its standing in the
        African fashion arena.
        Despite encountering challenges, Nairametrics anticipates that by the end of 2023,
        the Nigerian fashion industry will spearhead Africa’s fashion exports This projection
        aligns with the sector’s growing influence on the global stage, with Africa’s fashion
        exports commanding a substantial $15.5 billion valuation.
        The industry is poised to assert itself as a frontrunner, driven by an escalating global
        demand for authentically crafted “Made in Africa” designs. Underscored by
        UNESCO’s recent report on Africa’s potential to take the lead in shaping the global
        fashion landscape.
        Amidst a myriad of opportunities within the sector, a group of CEOs assumes a
        pivotal role, garnering international attention and elevating the market with distinctive
        “Made in Nigeria” offerings.
        These seasoned leaders, boasting a decade-long presence, significant growth
        impact, and noteworthy contributions to the national GDP, stand out as some of the
        key architects propelling Nigeria’s billion-dollar fashion industry to unprecedented

        title: "Nigeria’s transport inflation surprisingly falls for the first time in 2 years",
        content:`The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released Nigeria’s inflation report last week,
        indicating a surprising decline in transport inflation for the first time in over two years.
        Specifically, Nigeria’s transport inflation slowed to 27.04% in October 2023 from its
        two-year high of 27.18% recorded in the previous month.
        Notably, the last time transport inflation declined was in July 2019. The decline was
        despite the surge in the cost of transportation across different regions in the country
        following the removal of the petrol subsidy and the surge in crude oil prices.
        The removal of the petrol subsidy in Nigeria unleashed a seismic wave through the
        transport sector and the economy as large. Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) prices
        surged from a relatively modest average of N189 per litre to an astonishing N600, a
        staggering increase of over 200%.
        This abrupt and substantial hike in fuel prices had a cascading effect, rippling across
        the country’s transportation networks.
        As the cost of PMS soared, the nation witnessed a profound impact on
        transportation. The surge in fuel prices triggered a domino effect, affecting various
        modes of transport.
        Also, with the subsidy removal, Nigeria experienced a significant depreciation of the
        national currency, the naira, against the USD.
        The depreciation exceeded 40%, propelled by the floating of the local currency and
        the consolidation of multiple FX markets into the National Autonomous Foreign
        Exchange Market (NAFEM).
        This devaluation further exacerbated the challenges faced by the transport sector,
        particularly the aviation sector.
        The confluence of factors – subsidy removal, fuel price spikes, and currency
        devaluation – created a perfect storm for the air travel industry.
        Already contending with the escalating costs of aviation fuel, airlines found
        themselves navigating an even more treacherous terrain.
        Inflation is at its worst in over 18 years
        According to the NBS, Nigeria’s headline inflation rose to its highest level in over 18
        years, reaching 27.33% in October 2023 and representing the 10 consecutive
        month of increase.
        A breakdown of the report showed that both components of the headline index grew
        at a faster pace.
        On one hand, food inflation rose to 31.52% from 30.64% recorded in the
        previous month, and the highest level since August 2005. On the other hand,
        core inflation accelerated to 22.58%, representing the highest since December
        2006.
        In terms of contribution to the year-on-year inflation by divisional level, food and
        non-alcoholic beverages contributed the most with 14.16%, followed by
        household consumables (4.57%), clothing and footwear (2.09%), and transport
        (1.78%).
        The report also indicated that inflation in the urban region rose to 29.29%, while
        rural inflation galloped to 25.58% in the review month.
        What experts are saying
        During a Nairametrics Twitter Spaces session last week Thursday, Annie Olaloku
        Teriba, a policy and strategy consultant noted that the rising cost of transportation
        has partially contributed to the surge in Nigeria’s food inflation and by extension the
        headline index.
        Samuel Oyekanmi, a macroeconomic analyst also supported that rising
        transportation cost has filtered into other parts of the inflation index, particularly the
        food component.
        He noted that inflation has risen at a faster pace in the southern region of the country
        partially as a result of the impact of the rising cost of transportation on the final selling
        price.
        Meanwhile, the decline in transport inflation could indicate stability in the price of
        transport across the country. It is worth noting that this does not imply a decline in the
        cost of transport but rather in the pace of price increases.
        Bottom line
        Beyond the realm of transportation, these economic dynamics carried broader
        implications for Nigeria’s economy.
        The interplay of subsidy removal, fuel price hikes, and currency devaluation
        contributed to inflationary pressures, affecting businesses, consumers, and overall
        economic stability.
        The government, faced with the complex challenge of balancing economic growth
        and stability, may need to consider strategic policy adjustments.`,

        title: "Presco, Okomu shine amid unmet product demand",
        content:`Presco Plc and Okomu Oil Palm Company Plc Nigeria’s biggest palm oil producers’
        revenue and share price are rallying amid unmet product demand.
        The share prices of both companies combined are up 80% YtD taking their market
        capitalisation to N413.938 billion as of November 17, 2023, compared to N294.895
        billion at the beginning of the year. While Presco’s share price has gained 34.55%,
        Okomu is up 45.45%
        The rally in shares can be attributed to the positive financial performances of the
        companies, product demand, market outlook and the market share enjoyed by the
        companies.
        In 2022, Okomu Oil Palm recorded a year-on-year revenue growth of 58.64%,
        reaching N59.324 billion, compared to N37.395 billion in 2021.
        Similarly, Presco Plc achieved a 75.13% year-on-year growth in revenue, reaching
        N83.056 billion in 2022. This performance significantly outpaces the companies’ fiveyear compound annual growth rate, averaging at 26.70%.
        In addition to the increased global demand for palm oil driven by the Russia-Ukraine
        war, which significantly boosted revenue, the growth in revenue for these companies
        can also be attributed to higher product prices. According to Okomu Oil’s 2022
        Chairman’s report:
        “Despite the ongoing instability, both within and outside the country, the
        commodity prices of both of our company’s products increased in 2022, which, to
        a degree, helped to offset the substantial inflationary increases being
        experienced by businesses in 2022.”
        Specifically, Okomu Oil reported a 43% year-on-year increase in crude palm oil
        (CPO) prices and a 7% increase in rubber prices during the same period. These
        price increments played a significant role in contributing to the overall rise in revenue.
        The companies have released their 9-month 2023 results, which show a continuation
        of the positive trend in both top-line and bottom-line growth, along with health profit
        margins.
        During the nine months of 2023, Okomu reported revenue of N60.647 billion,
        surpassing its full-year 2022 revenue of N59.323 billion. Similarly, Presco reported
        revenue of N79.867 billion during the same period, about 93% of its full-year revenue
        for 2022.
        With this consistent growth, there is a strong likelihood that both companies will
        exceed their 2022 performance in terms of revenue generation by the end of the
        year.
        This is particularly beneficial for investors, especially those relying on dividends, as it
        is likely to spur growth in dividend payments.
        Both companies have a track record of consistent dividend payments over the past
        five years, and they offered one of the best dividend yields in the NGX market last
        year.
        As an early sign of this continuing trend, Okomu Oil and Presco Oil have already
        announced interim dividends of N4.50 and N2 per share, respectively, for the 2023
        financial year. A significant strength for both companies lies in the substantial local demand for their
        products. Local sales contribute to over 91% of their total revenue.
        Despite a 40% increase in export sales for Okomu Oil in the first nine months of
        2023, local sales continue to dominate, accounting for 91% of the total revenue.
        In the case of Presco, the reliance on local sales is even more pronounced,
        constituting 100% of the total revenue.
        In addition to the strong revenue performance, is that the companies have a high
        gross profit margin, averaging around 66%. This may reflect effective cost
        management.
        For instance, Okomu Oil, in a statement, highlighted its efforts to control costs,
        including the utilization of a newly fully commissioned 5MW turbine as an alternative
        power source in 2022, which resulted in the generation of over 44% of the power
        needed in the company’s primary estate, and that contributed not only to cost
        efficiency but also reducing the company’s carbon footprint.
        While a healthy gross profit margin can indeed suggest effective cost management, it
        is important to consider other factors, such as the demand-supply dynamics in the
        market.
        In a situation where there is a supply shortfall, companies may have the ability to
        command higher prices for their products, contributing to an elevated gross profit
        margin.
        In this context, the high gross profit margin for both companies may not solely be
        attributed to effective cost management but also to favourable market conditions,
        where the demand for their products exceeds supply.
        There seems to be a significant disparity between demand and production.
        According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),
        Nigeria’s palm oil production reached 1.4 million metric tons in 2022/2023.
        However, local consumption was approximated to be around 2.1 million metric tons,
        resulting in a shortfall of 0.7 million metric tons.
        Given an average yield of 0.5 tons per hectare, according to USDA data, producing
        this quantity would necessitate an estimated 1.4 million hectares of land.
        Presently, the combined plantation land of the two largest producers totals 58,489
        hectares. Okomu possesses 19,060 hectares of oil palm, and Presco holds a
        plantation land bank of 39,429 hectares.
        This disparity underscores a potential inadequacy and signals the need for
        expansion and investment, encouraging both the existing major producers and
        potential new entrants to explore these growth opportunities`,

        title: "Fixing Nigeria’s forex crisis – Financial experts weigh in",
        content:`Nigeria’s foreign exchange market has been under significant pressure recently,
        leading to a depreciation of the naira and concerns about economic stability.
        The naira’s recent depreciation has been attributed to a combination of factors,
        including increased demand for dollars, rising inflation, and concerns about the
        global economic outlook.
        To address these challenges and stabilize the exchange rate, the Central Bank of
        Nigeria (CBN) has implemented various measures, including raising interest rates
        and restricting access to foreign exchange. However, the effectiveness of these
        measures remains to be seen.
        To address this challenge, financial experts interviewed by Nairametrics exclusively
        noted that a multi-pronged approach is necessary, encompassing measures to boost
        domestic production, enhance market confidence, and implement sound fiscal and
        monetary policies.
        They noted that a crucial step towards alleviating the forex demand is to enhance
        domestic production, particularly in the petroleum sector. This involves enabling
        private and public refineries to operate at full capacity, reducing reliance on imported
        petroleum products.
        Additionally, fostering domestic manufacturing and agriculture will further reduce the
        need for foreign exchange to acquire essential goods.
        What the financial experts are saying
        The Executive Vice Chairman, of Hicap Securities Limited, Mr David Adonri also in
        an exclusive chat with Nairametrics said the government should enable private and
        public refineries to work
        He noted that the major cause of the imbalance is pressure from the excessive
        importation and the major part of the importation is petroleum products imports.
         “Hopefully when Dangote and public refineries start producing, then the
        massive importation of petroleum products will ease the pressure of the forex
        exchange market,” he said.
        Adonri called on the government to enhance the security network to facilitate
        domestic production to reduce import dependence and pressure on the naira.
        “Because the cost of depreciation of naira is the scarcity of hard currencies, then
        in the medium to long term, the restoration of securities and increase in domestic
        production will also ease the pressure on the foreign exchange market. This will
        enable the naira to regain ground,” he said.
        According to him, the government should also roll out other appropriate fiscal
        measures to close the supply gap in the economy.
        “They should understand that further use of monetary policy measures cannot
        rein in inflation because they have reached their limits as demand management
        strategies.
        Now that the monetary policies which are demand management strategy can no
        longer rein in inflation, then the only option left is the deployment of fiscal
        policies and actions,” he said. 
        Speaking on the effect of currency speculators, Adonri said there are speculators in
        every deregulated economy and that the speculation is caused by scarcity.
        “Once that scarcity is eliminated, speculation will suffer heavy losses that will
        serve as a market-based deterrent and disincentive for further speculation. That
        is an attribute of the market based on supply and demand. 
        The government should not use administrative methods to discipline speculators
        in the market, they should allow the normal market design to take its cause
        rather than imposing discipline on speculators,” he said.
        The former President and Chairman governing council of, the Chartered Institute of
        Stockbrokers (CIS) and the Managing Director, of Arthur Steven Asset Management
        Limited, Mr. Olatunde Amolegbe also in an exclusive chat with Nairametrics said for
        the exchange rate to be stable, market and participants confidence is key.
        “Confidence is what makes foreigners want to come to invest in your country and
        make locals want to keep their investments here.
        In the absence of these dynamics, demand will naturally outstrip supply and you
        see the sort of instability we are experiencing now. 
        I think the decision to clear FX commitment backs will be positive for market
        confidence, but the desired impact might manifest in the medium term rather
        than in the short run.
        I also think the efforts at using monetary policy tools to reduce system liquidity
        could ultimately reduce currency speculation but again it’s not a silver bullet. 
        Deliberate efforts need to intensify at effecting structural changes that will
        encourage import substitution such as improved security, better infrastructure
        increased foreign direct investments, and encouraging local production,” he said.
        Tajudeen Olayinka, CEO of Wyoming Capital and Partner, said the foreign exchange
        market, like any other market around the world, has a demand side and supply side,
        the same way the economy as a whole has a demand side and supply side.
        Olayinka noted that when there exists intense pressure on the market from the
        demand side, the supply side will need to adjust itself to meet the surge in demand.
        “This process continues until the equilibrium exchange rate is achieved. Where
        the government is seen to deliberately manipulate the exchange rate, then there
        will be no equilibrium exchange rate in the market, and so, an unofficial market
        or black market would evolve to satisfy the desires of different players to have
        foreign exchange transactions and other non-foreign exchange transactions
        delivered at an equilibrium exchange rate, thus, creating exchange rate
        divergence. 
        The resultant divergence would force the official supply side to continue to
        disappear, creating a liquidity challenge for the market. 
        This was the problem we found ourselves in before the unification policy of the
        current administration. Regrettably, the persistent exchange rate divergence and
        the resultant liquidity challenge have forced the critical supply side players to
        disappear from the market, and by extension, the economy,” he said.
        On what should the government of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu do, Olayinka noted
        that the only course of action to remedy the current situation is to reset the economy
        through a comprehensive adjustment program.
        A comprehensive adjustment program is designed to correct disequilibria between
        aggregate domestic demand and supply where macroeconomic imbalances exist.
        “This program must be driven by adjustment experts who understand the
        dynamics of the adjustment program. 
        The essence is to move the economy towards attaining internal equilibrium,
        while also trying to restore external equilibrium. 
        The government started without a blueprint of how and when the program should
        commence. Adjustment Program is not a tea party and cannot be implemented
        with mere pronouncement. Thankfully, we still have a way out,” he said.`,

        title: "Nigeria’s crude oil output rises by 10% in 5 months under Tinubu’s presidency",
        content:`Five months after Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was sworn in as president in May
        2023, Nigeria’s crude oil production rate has increased by a mere 131,926 barrels
        per day.
        This figure is based on a Nairametrics review of available data from the Nigerian
        Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC).
        When Tinubu assumed office in May 2023, Nigeria’s daily crude oil production,
        including condensates, reached 1,430,146 barrels.
        The following month, in June 2023, this output rose to 1,499,416 barrels per day.
        However, July 2023 witnessed a slight decrease, with production recorded at
        1,303,428 barrels daily. August 2023 saw an increase, reaching 1,414,664 barrels
        per day.
        September 2023 marked a significant milestone for the year, as Nigeria achieved its
        highest production thus far, hitting 1,572,315 barrels per day.
        However, in October 2023, there was a minor dip, and production levels slightly
        decreased to 1,562,072 barrels per day.
        Across these months, Nigeria experienced fluctuations in its daily crude oil output,
        with certain months recording increases and others witnessing marginal declines.
        Separate ministers; separate goals
        When Bola Ahmed Tinubu was sworn in as Nigeria’s president in May 2023, he
        separated gas from petroleum, effectively naming Ekperikpe Ekpo as the country’s
        minister for petroleum resources (gas) and Heineken Lokpobiri as minister of state
        for petroleum resources. This would be the first of its kind in the country.
        The idea was welcomed by many in the industry, stating that it would create room for
        both ministers to focus primarily on their respective objectives. For Lokpobiri, it would
        be to increase the country’s crude oil production, for Ekpo; to transition Nigeria to a
        gas-based economy.
        On the part of the oil sector, it is important to note that since assuming his role as
        minister of state for petroleum resources, Lokpobiri has engaged in multiple meetings
        with various stakeholders and investors, aiming to strategize and revitalize Nigeria’s
        energy sector between August and November 2023.
        In August 2023, Lokpobiri conducted visits to the Port Harcourt and Warri refineries,
        where assurances were given that the Port Harcourt facility would resume operations
        by December 2023, and the Warri refinery would follow suit by the first quarter of
        2024.
        Throughout September, a series of pivotal meetings occurred: Lokpobiri held
        discussions with officials from the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC)
        and also met with representatives from SINOPEC, emphasizing the strengthening of
        relations and a commitment to boost local oil production.
        Additionally, the Minister took charge of resolving a divestment disagreement
        between NNPCL and ExxonMobil, aiming to augment the country’s oil and gas
        output.
        Later in September, Lokpobiri convened meetings to enhance partnerships, including
        talks with Shell’s Executive Vice President. He also highlighted Nigeria’s eagerness
        to operate under the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and aiming to achieve a production
        milestone of over 2 million barrels of oil per day between December 2023 and early
        2024.
        The minister also made pledges toward localizing petroleum production by engaging
        operators in supplying crude to modular refineries to meet local demand.
        As October progressed, he met with local oil companies like Oando Plc to fortify their
        ability to effectively manage assets previously owned by international oil
        corporations.
        In November 2023, Lokpobiri signed an energy cooperation Memorandum of
        Understanding with Saudi Arabia and had discussions with Daewoo E & C Limited
        and Seplat Energy, aimed at fortifying Nigeria’s refining capabilities and resolving the
        NNPCL and ExxonMobil divestment dispute, initiated earlier in September 2023.
        Why oil production is still not impressive
        Despite action steps taken by Lokpobiri and other stakeholders in the Tinubu-led
        administration, oil production levels are still not as high as they could be. Note that
        Nigeria has consistently failed to meet its 1.7 million barrels per day quota assigned
        by OPEC.
        Some analysts are of the opinion that until the government and operators effectively
        put a stop to crude oil theft and vandalism in the Niger Delta region, investors, both
        existing and potential, can only make pledges and may not be willing to risk having
        their assets vandalized in the region.
        Note that from May 2023 to the first week of November 2023, weekly data from the
        Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) reviewed by Nairametrics
        shows that there have been over 5,000 crude oil theft incidents across the oilproducing areas of the country.
        The NNPCL keeps providing weekly data on these incidents despite efforts by
        Nigerian security agencies and third-party partners like the Tompolo-led Tantita
        Security Agency to curb the menace.
        Industry analysts highlight that, apart from the issue of crude oil theft, maintaining
        consistent transparency within the oil sector holds significant potential to attract more
        investors.
        They advocate for transforming the industry from a closed-off environment to an
        open and accessible sector, where real-time data on activities like seismic surveys,
        drilling, and environmental impact assessments are readily available to both
        investors and the public.
        By enhancing transparency and making industry-related information easily
        accessible, this shift aims to create a more informed and inclusive environment. It is
        anticipated that such openness will empower potential and current investors to swiftly
        make informed business decisions.
        This proactive decision-making, facilitated by access to comprehensive and up-todate data, could not only lead to increased oil production but also reshape the
        Nigerian oil sector’s image.
        Oil market analyst, Dan D. Kunle told Nairametrics:
        “The envisioned transparency within the industry would provide investors with a
        clearer understanding of ongoing activities and potential opportunities. It allows
        them to gauge the impact of their investments and ensures alignment with
        industry practices and environmental regulations.
        “This transparency does not only benefit investors; it also allows the public to
        comprehend the industry’s operations and associated impacts.”
        However, in September 2023, the special adviser on energy to President Tinubu, Ms.
        Olu Verheijen revealed that the administration had secured $13 billion worth of oil
        and gas investment from Chevron, Total, Shell, NAOC, Exxon Mobil, Seplat, Heirs
        Holdings, Waltersmith, First E&P, and others. According to her, it is anticipated that
        the $13.5 billion in short-term investment components, currently in the pipeline, will
        pave the way for the delivery of 2.1 million barrels per day production by December
        2024, barring any unforeseen challenges.`,

        title: "NigComSat-1R: Nigeria wants to put its satellite to full use 3 years to expiration",
        content:`The new management of the Nigerian Communications Satellite company is
        making moves to get the country’s satellite fully utilized after being underutilized
        for several years.
        These moves may, however, be coming late as the satellite has only 3 years left
        to complete its lifespan.
        NIGCOMSAT will also need to tackle the issues that have led to Nigerian
        telecom operators abandoning their service to source for satellite services
        outside the country.
        Recent activities of the newly appointed Managing Director of the Nigerian
        Communications Satellite, Jane Nkechi Egerton-Idehen suggested that the country
        now wants to put its communication satellite to good use after being underutilized
        over the last 12 years.
        This may, however, be coming a little late as the 12-year-old NigComSat-1R satellite
        is to expire in the next 3 years. The satellite which has 15 years lifespan was
        launched in 2011 and is to reach its complete lifespan in 2026.
        The satellite was launched with the hope that it would save Nigeria billions in foreign
        exchange by providing service for Nigerian telecom operators and broadcast
        stations.
        It was also expected to help boost the country’s broadband penetration, but all has
        been a mirage since its launch as many businesses, including government agencies
        like the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, have shunned the satellite over
        the years.
        Egerton-Idehen’s revival talks
        While the industry is awaiting her actions, the newly appointed CEO of the satellite
        company, Egerton-Idehen has been sharing what she described as her vision to
        transform the company.
        According to her, NIGCOMSAT is now better positioned than ever to provide the
        nation with reliable internet services that will stimulate innovation and other
        advancements in the technology industry. Talking tough during her maiden tour of the company’s facilities in Lagos, she
        boasted that NigComSat will double up on the ways it used to deliver services to the
        ICT sector, in order to match the aspirations of the present government on digital
        economy.
        She assured that the satellite company would help the Ministry of Communications,
        Innovation, and Digital Economy to build the necessary infrastructure that will fasten
        the technological growth of the country.
        Egerton-Idehen said the first step towards doing that would be to reposition the
        satellite company and put it in a position that will help to escalate broadband
        penetration to un-served and underserved areas of the country.
        “Picture Aminu, Ada, or Ade on his/her remote farm, engaging on a marketplace
        platform with an AI chatbot to determine the current price of cash crops for his
        suppliers. Envision a Nigeria where the utilization of ICT impacts all spheres. A
        good example was the significant impact of ICT during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        “Now, imagine a country, Nigeria, and a continent, Africa, where we utilize ICT to
        drive transparency in government and improve the quality and cost of public
        service delivery. This is not just the future; it is the goal. It will significantly
        increase ICT’s GDP contribution (17.8% in Q1 2023 and 19.54% in Q2 2023) for
        Nigeria.
        “These are big and audacious goals, yet we are not the first to attempt them. In a
        similar stride, countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are pursuing
        diversification despite their extensive oil and gas reserves. This is the picture of
        the future we want for Nigeria, with intense efforts from NIGCOMSAT in
        collaboration with other sister agencies, government bodies, and the private
        sector,” she said.
        NIGCOMSAT’s edtech solution
        Coming as the first action to back up Egerton-Idehen’s words and promises,
        NIGCOMSAT last week unveiled its Educational Technology (EdTech) solutions
        during a strategic meeting in Abuja. According to the company, the solutions will
        utilize satellite broadband connectivity to revolutionize education in Nigeria.
        At the meeting themed, “NIGCOMSAT is open for business” the company’s MD said
        the desire to advance education through tech was what spurred this edtech project
        from NIGCOMSAT.
        “By providing schools with a bundled solution, access to affordable reliable
        internet, and leveraging edtech resources and interventions designed in
        alignment with the Nigerian curriculum, a more equitable and effective education
        can be achieved,” she said.
        According to the Executive Director of Marketing and Business Development of
        NIGCOMSAT, Mr. Najeem Salaam, NIGCOMSAT now has a new goal with its
        upgraded broadband and broadcasting capacity platform to provide Nigerians with
        better access to opportunities.
        “NIGCOMSAT is therefore open for even greater business opportunities for all.
        The Nigeria of our dream is achievable, and we have started doing the work
        already. NIGCOMSAT is ours together as Nigerians, and we must grow our own
        and make the best out of it,” he said.
        Failed moves to replace NIGCOMSAT-1R
        While the new management of NIGCOMSAT is trying to reposition the company, the
        fact that its main asset, NIGCOMSAT-1R will be expiring in the next 3 years may
        create a setback except the government launches another satellite to replace it
        before 2026.
        Before his exit in 2019, one of the former Ministers of Communications, Barrister
        Adebayo Shittu, had insisted that Nigeria needed two new satellites to act as a
        backup for the current one. He had announced plans to approach China-Exim Bank
        to secure a loan of $550 million for the purpose.
        This, however, met stiff resistance from stakeholders, who argued that the current
        satellite operated by the country has been a wasted investment as it is not profitable
        and is being underutilised.
        In 2021, former of NIGCOMSAT, Dr. Abimbola Alale, also announced at a
        stakeholder forum that the company was about to acquire two more satellites.
        “l am pleased to inform stakeholders of our desire to acquire more satellites
        between now and 2025 with the NigComSat-2 (Hight Throughput Satellite) due
        for launch in 2023 while NigComSat-3 will be launched in 2025,” she said at the
        time.
        Legal Adviser and Company Secretary of the company, Alma Okpalefe, added that
        the planned launch of the two satellites in 2023 and 2025, would help NIGCOMSAT
        meet up with its mandate to commercialize satellite resources in the country and
        provide quality and cheap satellite services to Nigerians.
        Last year, the federal government had also budgeted N2.5 billion for the acquisition
        of a second satellite, NIGCOMSAT 2, but it was not implemented.
        Provision for NIGCOMSAT in 2022 approved budget
        Why Nigerian businesses have shunned NIGCOMSAT
        One major factor that has led to the underutilization of the NIGCOMSAT satellite is
        the fact that many businesses in Nigeria, especially, telecommunications companies
        have refused to patronize it over the years.
        According to a former President of the Association of Telecommunications
        Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Mr Olusola Teniola, most telecommunications
        companies in Nigeria are sourcing their satellite services from abroad because it is
        cheaper than in-country.
        “The issue with NIGCOMSAT is the pricing. Service providers are taking
        capacities from foreign satellites because of that and this has been going on for
        quite some time,” he said.
        Teniola said for the company to attract local operators, it has to review its pricing and
        also create service differentiation by offering what the telcos cannot get from foreign
        satellite services.
        Similarly, the President of the Nigeria Internet Group (NIG), Mr Destiny Amana, said
        high-cost service from NIGCOMSAT had been driving many Internet Service
        Providers (ISPs) to patronize foreign satellites.
        According to him, it is far cheaper to obtain satellite services from outside the
        country, compared to local facilities.
        NigComSat-1R journey
        On March 24, 2009, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Science and Technology,
        NIGCOMSAT, Limited, and China Great Wall Industry Corporation, CGWIC, signed a
        contract for the in-orbit delivery of the NigComSat-1R satellite. It was a replacement
        for the failed NigComSat-1 which was launched on May 13, 2007.
        Subsequently, on December 19, 2011, NigComSat-1R, paid for with the insurance
        policy on the de-orbited NigComSat-1 according to former President Goodluck
        Jonathan, was successfully launched into orbit by China in Xichang.
        The satellite was designed to function in the areas of communications, internet
        services, health, agriculture, environmental protection, and national security before
        completing its 15-year lifespan.`,

        title: "Dividend stocks poise for growth in 2024",
        content:`These stocks present investors with an opportunity to enjoy both substantial
        dividends and significant share price appreciation as they gear up for a strong
        performance in 2024.
        Zenith Bank: This banking giant stock currently offers a yield, surpassing 10%,
        making it one of the highest on the NGX.
        Mansard: Despite being a penny stock, Mansard stands out with a robust
        dividend yield and a promising growth trajectory.
        Okomu Oil: This palm oil company currently provides a healthy yield, and its
        impressive 9M post-tax profit growth adds to its appeal.
        Access Holdings: The Tier-1 bank boasts of a track record of consistent
        dividend payments and an impressive 29.81% dividend Compound Annual
        Growth Rate (CAGR) over the past 5 years.
        UBA: This banking stock currently offers a relatively strong yield, and its
        earnings for the first nine months of 2023 have more than doubled.
        Dividends provide a reliable return on capital, offering a steady stream of investment
        income to shareholders. This attribute makes dividends a crucial consideration,
        particularly for individuals living in retirement.
        However, dividends can be tricky. High-yielding dividends are sometimes associated
        with stocks whose share prices are lagging or underperforming the broader market.
        Typically, as share prices decrease, the dividend yield, calculated as the dividend
        payment divided by the share price, tends to rise; buttressing the inverse relationship
        between share price and dividend yield.
        The challenge lies in identifying stocks that strike a balance between appreciating
        share prices and a robust dividend payout.
        Identifying such stocks may pose a challenge, but they certainly exist. Presented
        here are dividend stocks that offer a blend of both growth and income, positioning
        themselves for significant upward momentum in 2024.
        Zenith Bank
        The most capitalized bank offers investors one of the highest-yielding dividends,
        currently at 10.18%.
        However, there are other reasons to like Zenith Bank stock beyond the dividend. The
        company has been reporting improving earnings. In 9M 2023, the bank reported one
        of the highest pre-tax profits.
        Furthermore, the company has shown signs of a share price recovery in 2023 after
        experiencing a year-to-date loss of 4.57% in 2022. This positive momentum is
        expected to be sustained into 2024.
        The post-tax profit for Zenith Bank experienced a significant growth of 149%. This
        substantial increase reinforces the optimistic outlook for the company’s performance.
        In the second and third quarters of this year, Zenith Bank announced earnings per
        share (EPS) of N7.19 and N3.29, contributing to a trailing twelve-month EPS of
        N15.41.
        Gross earnings also saw a significant rise of 114% from the previous year, reaching
        N1.329 trillion, 63% higher than the full-year gross earnings in 2022.
        The bank’s cash and cash equivalents at the end of the 9M 2023 period increased by
        42% to N2.71 trillion. This strong cash position is a positive factor that can provide
        support for the payment of dividends, enhancing the overall appeal of Zenith Bank
        stock to investors.
        AXA Mansard
        The insurance and asset management company provides a dividend that is betterthan-industry/sector average. Shareholders of the company received an annual
        dividend payment of N0.42 per share giving it a yield of 9.15%.
        Over the past five years, Mansard has consistently paid dividends for four
        consecutive years. Despite facing a 35% year-on-year decline in Profit After Tax
        (PAT) in 2022, the company paid out 133% of its earnings in dividends. This marked
        a substantial 44% growth in dividend payments.
        The company increased its PAT by 738% to N12.555 billion in 9M 2023. This figure
        significantly outpaces the N2.435 billion recorded for the entire 2022 fiscal year.
        The positive trend observed in the first three quarters is expected to persist into the
        fourth quarter, providing a strong foundation for an anticipated increase in dividend
        payments.
        Considering the consistent dividend payouts, even during challenging periods, and
        the substantial growth in PAT, there is a compelling case to believe that AXA
        Mansard is well-positioned to sustain and potentially increase its dividend in 2024.
        Okomu Oil
        The increase in Okomu Oil’s share price by about 46% Year-to-Date (YtD) in the
        current year, following a gain of 16% in 2022, suggests a positive trend in the
        market’s perception of the company.
        Investors are showing increased confidence in Okomu Oil, as reflected in the upward
        movement of its share price.
        The dividend yield of Okomu Oil is noted to be relatively good at 8.54%. This implies
        that Okomu Oil is providing investors with a return of 8.54% on their investment
        through dividends.
        The palm oil producer has a good dividend payment record. It has paid dividends
        consistently over the past years, boasting of CAGR of 48%.
        In 2022, it distributed 122% of its earnings in dividends, showcasing an impressive
        163% dividend growth rate.
        The financial performance of Okomu Oil in 2022 was impressive, with a 41% growth
        in Profit After Tax.
        This positive trend has continued in 2023, with post-tax profit increasing by 16%
        Year-on-Year to N20.921 billion, surpassing the N16.231 billion recorded for the
        entire 2022 fiscal year.
        Given the consistent dividend payments, robust dividend growth rates, and the
        company’s strong financial performance in 9M 2023, there is a compelling indication
        that Okomu Oil is well-positioned to potentially increase its dividend in 2024.
        Access Holding
        Access Holding share price has been impressive this year; boasting a year-to-date
        gain of 102.94%.
        Despite this substantial increase, the share price offers a compelling dividend yield of
        9.28%, making it one of the highest on the NGX.
        Over a five-year period, dividend payments have grown by about 30% per year. Even
        in 2022, when there was a slight decline of 5% in PAT, it paid out 35% of its earnings
        in dividends, representing a 50% growth rate in dividends for that year. This year, it
        has declared and paid an interim dividend of N0.30 per share.
        Access is also a consistent performer when it comes to financial performance. Most
        recently, the company announced a 9M EPS of N6.92 and gross earnings of N1.593
        trillion. That beat 2022 full-year gross earnings of N1.388 trillion.
        Moreover, the robust net cash flow generated from operating activities, totalling
        N1.406 trillion, adds further strength to the company’s ability to sustain its dividend
        payment trend.
        The substantial net cash flow from operating activities is a crucial factor in supporting
        the company’s dividend payments.
        UBA
        United Bank for Africa (UBA): UBA has demonstrated an exceptional 173% Year-toDate growth in its share price, coupled with an appealing dividend yield of 6.75%,
        resulting in an overall impressive total return of 179.77%.
        This surge in the share price appears to find solid support in the bank’s fundamental
        strength. In the first nine months of 2023, UBA reported the highest post-tax profit on
        the NGX, with a 287% Year-on-Year growth in Profit After Tax.
        Over the past five years, UBA has consistently rewarded shareholders with dividend
        payments, maintaining an average annual growth rate of 5.29%.
        In 2022, the bank increased its dividend payments by 10% YoY, and this positive
        trend has persisted into the current year, with UBA elevating its dividend payment by
        an impressive 67%.
        The substantial growth in dividend payouts during the H1 2023 period, coupled with
        the remarkable earnings growth experienced so far this year (likely to surpass the
        2022 full-year figure), suggests a promising outlook for dividend increases in 2024`,
